                    you'll notice that everything here is lowercase. i decided to remove the caps lock and shift keys from my workflow.

                    i find it soothing for my mental health and the simplicity and visual continuity are a beautiful combination.

                    there are cases where an occasional uppercase letter is necessary like when a coding language requires it. hopefully we can see that change in time. maybe the keys on our keyboards will be lowercase someday too like they should be in their pre-shifted state. after we all convert, maybe we can use the caps lock key for fun sound effects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    we won't be able to convince everyone to switch right away, but wherever you can, i hope you'll join the <b>#lowercase</b> movement.
