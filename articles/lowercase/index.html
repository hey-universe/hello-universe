                    you'll notice that everything here is lowercase. i've recently decided that removing the caps lock and shift keys from my workflow is good for my mental health. the simplicity and visual continuity is also a beautiful thing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    there are cases where an occasional uppercase letter is necessary like when a coding language requires it. hopefully we can see that change in time. maybe the keys on our keyboards will be lowercase someday too, like they should be already in their pre-shifted state. after we've all converted, maybe we can use the caps lock key for fun sound effects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    we won't be able to convince everyone to switch right away, but wherever you can, i hope you'll join the <b>#lowercase</b> movement.
