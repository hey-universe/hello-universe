                    this is my first blog post. i've wanted to write for a long time and i'm finally getting past the anxiety and starting today.
                </p>

                <p>
                    so far my writing experience only includes my music review blog (mattfm) from over a decade ago, and my current job as a technical writer which is much less creative.
                </p>

                <h2>the fears</h2>
                <p>
                    one of the topics i'll likely write about often is web and software development. a of fear associated with this industry is that code examples and concepts become outdated quickly leaving you with irrelevant posts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    another fear in the development industry is that there is most often more than one, if not many ways to solve a problem and there can be large populations in each camp. negative responses to your chosen approach can be stressful even if it's just as valid.
                </p>

                <p>
                    to combat these fears personally i'll repeat the mantra of:
                    <blockquote>
                        "trying and making mistakes is a better learning experience than doing nothing at all"
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        -idk
                    </blockquote>
                </p>

                <h2>the hopes</h2>

                <p>
                    there are several hopes and motivations behind the decision to start writing.
                    <ul>
                        <li>skill improvement (researching, writing, etc).</li>
                        <li>networking opportunities with interesting people.</li>
                        <li>a love of learning and a love of teaching.</li>
                        <li>overcoming introvert related mental blocks.</li>
                        <li>gateway to creating video content.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>an energy experiment</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>lack of energy</b> is a problem in my daily life right now. it has become devastating to productivity. i think lack of enthusiasm for current day-to-day tasks is part of the problem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    i'm hoping that when i have my sleepy, brain fog moments, that <b>taking a writing break</b> with up my enthusiasm level give my brain the boost it needs to continue being productive. i'll also be researching diet and supplement related solutions to maximize daily output before my brain overheats.
                </p>

                <h2>comments</h2>

                <p>
                    with my chosen simple site stack, i don't have a way to add a comments form for posts. if you comment on my x.com post for an article, with an interesting review, i'll manually add the comment to the article. <a href="https://x.com/hellouniverseco" target="_blank">@hellouniverseco</a>
